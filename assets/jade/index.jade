div#philosophy
  h3 Philosophy
  p
    | I believe in thoughtful, elegant coding. Coming from a low-level system 
    | programming background, I value mindfulness of every aspect of a web-based 
    | application design: performances and appropriate engineering, before shine 
    | and mindless richness of features, are essential to ensure a satisfying 
    | experience for the end-user and a cost-effective workflow for the people 
    | I work with.
  p
    | I am passionate about what I do. Since I put my hands on my first computer 
    | at the age of 13, I've been always drawn towards the beauty of writing code, 
    | and the pleasure of creating out of thin air things that solved problems in 
    | some clever ways or made people's lives easier or happier. I enjoy engineering 
    | and developing interactive web applications and I'm always looking for the 
    | next thing to learn.
  p
    | Curiosity, the drive to solve new problems and to improve on old ones are 
    | core values to me.
